					<p>
						Processed junk food is incredibly unhealthy.
					</p>

					<p>
						These foods have been engineered to trigger your pleasure centers, so they trick your brain into overeating
						—
						even promoting food addiction in some people.
					</p>

					<p>
						They’re usually low in fiber, protein, and micronutrients but high in unhealthy ingredients like added sugar
						and refined grains. Thus, they provide mostly empty calories.
